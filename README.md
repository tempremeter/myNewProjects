This product is intended for the small home owners and handymen engage in occasional repairs, maintenance and small construction projects. It originated from many observations of grossly inaccurate estimating of material requirements leading to incomplete construction, to the embarrassment of the home owner. It is also the product of observations of frequent work on small projects that result in repeatedly similar requirements.

It is a free distribution. If you paid for this product you have been defrauded and you may wish to pursue legal action as a result.

This product is not intended for professional work, but if you wish to do so, you should satisfy yourself of the suitability and accuracy, in view of the building code for your jurisdiction. You must therefore accept full responsibility for the outcome.

The code will be posted in its entirety in the future, after sufficient feedback and enquiries to develop the help information
